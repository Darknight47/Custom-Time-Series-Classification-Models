# CustomMultilayerPerceptron
It is a standard baseline to exploit deep neural networks for end-to-end time series classification without any crafting in feature engineering and data preprocessing.
The Idea of this custm Multilayer Perceptron or the baseline model is from:
[Time Series Classification from Scratch with Deep Neural Networks: A Strong Baseline (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06455)
