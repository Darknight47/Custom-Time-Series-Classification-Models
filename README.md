# Custom Time Series Classification Models
## Here I explore two custom classification models for three different time series datasets!
They are standard baselines to exploit deep neural networks for end-to-end time series classification without any crafting in feature engineering and data preprocessing.  

### First model, A custom multilayer perceptron
The plain baselines are basic MLP by stacking three fully connected layers.

### Second model, A custom Fully Convolutional Networks
FCN has shown compelling quality and efficiency for semantic segmentation on images. 

The Idea of these custom models for time seires classfication is taken from:
